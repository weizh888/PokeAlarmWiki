## Prerequisites
This guide assumes:

1. You have a working RocketMap installation
2. You are familiar with [JSON formatting](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
3. You have read and understood the [Alarms](alarms) Wiki
4. You are comfortable with the layout of `alarms.json`.
5. You are using the latest version of PokeAlarm

## Introduction


All alarms in the `alarms.json` alarm configuration file have customizable fields for each alert that allow you to insert your own message. This allows your to override the standard message and provide your own. You may customize as few or as many fields as you want - any field not present in your config will reset to default.

**Note:** The alarm configuration file is the only file within the PokeAlarm installation that you are **required** to directly edit (`config.ini` file is optional.)  Editing other files in your PokeAlarm installation directory is not supported.

In order to customize an Alert, you must specify what type of alert you want to config: Either `pokemon`, `pokestop`, `gym`, `egg`, or `raid`. Each of these has different defaults available. The following is an `alarms` config where a portion of the Alert has been updated:

```json
{
	"type":"slack",
	"active":"True",
	"api_key":"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
	"pokemon":{
		"channel":"Pokemon",
		"username":"<pkmn>",
		"title":"A GIANT <pkmn> jumped out of the grass!",
		"body": "Available until <24h_time> (<time_left>)."
	},
	"pokestop":{
		"channel":"Pokestop",
		"title":"Someone  has placed a lure on a Pokestop!",
		"body":"Better hurry! The lure only has <time_left> remaining!"
	}
}
```

The above might produce the following customized pokemon and pokestop notifications:

#### Pokemon notification output
> A GIANT Dragonite jumped out of the grass! Availble until 12:34:56 (14m 59s) remaining!

#### Pokestop notification output
> Better hurry! The lure only has 12m 34s remaining!

For what fields (title, message, etc) you have the option to change, please see the wiki page for the specific service.

## Pokemon Text

**Note:** There are **two** `pokemon` keys in `alarms.json` - one at the top level, and another optional at the alarm level.  The follow text substitutions below pertain to the `pokemon` field in the `alarms:[]` level.

## Reverse Location Text
The following text substitutions will only work if a Google Maps API Key with Geocoding API enabled has been provided to the PokeAlarm.

| Text             | Description                            |
|:---------------- |:---------------------------------------|
| `<street_num>`   | Street number of the alert location    |
| `<street>`       | Street name of the alert location      |
| `<address>`      | Address of the alert location, includes both street number and street name, in that order only |
| `<postal>`       | Postal code of the alert location      |
| `<neighborhood>` | Neighborhood code of the alert location|
| `<sublocality>`  | Sublocality code of the alert location |
| `<city>`         | City code of the alert location        |
| `<county>`       | County code of the alert location      |
| `<state>`        | State code of the alert location       |
| `<country>`       | Country code of the alert location    |
The fields will return `None` if unable to derive a proper location

Each pokemon, pokestop, or gym will use up 1 point of your API quota, regardless of number of fields or alarms used.

## Distance Matrix Text
The following text substitutions will only work if a Google Maps API Key with Distance Matrix API enabled has been provided to the PokeAlarm.

| Text             | Description                            |
|:---------------- |:---------------------------------------|
| `<walk_dist>`    | Estimated walking distance to the alert location |
| `<walk_time>`    | Estimated walking time to alert location|

| Text             | Description                            |
|:---------------- |:---------------------------------------|
| `<bike_dist>`    | Estimated bike distance to the alert location |
| `<bike_time>`    | Estimated bike time to alert location|


| Text             | Description		                            |
|:---------------- |:-----------------------------------------------|
| `<drive_dist>`   | Estimated drive distance to the alert location |
| `<drive_time>`   | Estimated drive time to alert location			|

Each table represents 1 API quota used for all parameters per pokemon, pokestop, or gym regardless of number of fields or alarms specified. For example, `<walk_time>` and `<drive_time>` would require 2 points, but `<walk_time>` and `<walk_dist>` would only require 1 (per alert).

## Example: Slack

Below is an example for a single Slack alarm.

Let's say that a Dragonite spawns nearby.  You want PokeAlarm to post to your Slack **#general** channel with the format below:

> Dragonite (#149) at 830 5th Avenue 10065 (328m SW) - Available until 15:40:37 (14m 45s remaining)

>**Walking:** 328m SW, ~3 mins

>**Moves:** Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw

>**IVs:** 100% (15/15/15)

(Pretend that the above is single spaced - silly github.)

In other words, there is a Dragonite, pokemon number 149, at the given address, 328 meters southwest of your stated location when you launched `start_pokealarm.py` (assuming you ran with the `-l` argument and provided an address or coordinates).  It will be there until 17:40:37 (5:40pm), and you have 14 minutes and 45 seconds to catch it.
