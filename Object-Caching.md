### Prerequisities
  
This guide assumes:

1. You have a functional PokeAlarm installation
2. You have a basic understanding of how to manage binary files
3. You have read and understood the available Command Line Arguments in the [Server Settings](server-settings) Wiki

### Introduction

PokeAlarm uses `Cache` objects to store information that is not present on runtime.  The cached objects store informatino such as `gym-info` and other dynamic objects sent into PokeAlarm via webhook.  Cached data is used for internal calcuations as well as to provide details for [Dynamic Text Substitution](dynamic-text-substitution) in [Alarms](alarms). 

### Caching Methods

There are currently two methods available for object caching:

| Caching Method          | Description                                                      |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mem`                   | Caches data to memory only, information is lost between sessions |
| `file`                  | Caches data to binary files located in the `cache` folder        |

_Note: If no cache-type is selected, `mem` will be chosen as the default._

## Memory Cache

When using the `mem` cache type, cached data is stored in memory only and is cleared whenever PA exits.  This will cause all [DTS](dynamic-text-substitution) fields which require this data to display an `unknown` or `null` value until the data is received by PA through webhooks.  

## Binary File Cache

When using the `file` cache type, cached data is written to a binary file located in the `cache/` directory.  Each [Manager](managers) has a unique binary cache file stored as `cache/<manager_name>.cache`.  Cached data is backed up to this binary file once per minute and immediately before PA exits.

# Multiple Instances

Using File caching with multiple instances can cause conflicts as cache files are stored under `<manager_name>.cache`.  When using the `file` cache type and multiple instances, take caution and ensure that all managers are assigned an explicitly unique name.

### Clearing Cache

* **Memory Cache** is cleared whenever PA exits for any reason.  
* **File Caches** may be cleared by deleting the `cache/<manager_name>.cache` file that cooresponds to the manager you wish to clear the cache for.  (To clear all cached data, delete all files in the cache folder).  PA will need to be restarted once cache files are erased.
