## Patch 3.4

### Server Settings

* Implemented caching for managers with `-ct` or `--cache_type`. Cache is used to handling remembering things like pokemon history and gym names.
    * (default) `mem` - data persists only in memory.
    * `file` - data is saved and loaded from a file.
* PA now gracefully exits on ctrl+c, finishing items in queue and logging the status of managers.

### Dynamic Text Substitutions

* **All**

    * `lat_5` and `lng_5` - Latitude and Longitude for the event, truncated to 5 decimal places.
    * `address_eu` - same as `<street> <street_num>`.

* **Pokemon**

    * `form_or_empty` - Reports the form name of the pokemon if known, or an empty string if unknown.
    * `pkmn_id_3` - pokemon id padded to 3 digits.
    * `form_id_or_emtpy` - prints form_id padded to 3 digits if known, or and empty string if unknown.

* **Raids**
    * `form_or_empty` - Reports the form name of the pokemon if known, or an empty string if unknown.
    * `team_name` - Reports the current team for a Raid gym if known, or 'unknown' if not.
    * `team_id` - Reports the current team id for a Raid gym if known, or '?' if not.
    * `min_cp` and `max_cp` - min and max potential cp for the raid boss if caught.
    * `pkmn_id_3` - pokemon id padded to 3 digits.
    * `form_id_or_emtpy` - prints form_id padded to 3 digits if known, or and empty string if unknown.

#### Server Settings
